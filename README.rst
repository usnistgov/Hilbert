Hilbert - Discrete Hilbert Transform Implementations
============================================================

**Hilbert** is a project that will contain numerous implementations of the discrete Hilbert transform.

Currently, this package is a work in progress and should probably not be used. *hilbertfft* is the
same as that implemented in `CRIkit2<https://github.com/CCampJr/CRIkit2/blob/master/crikit/cri/algorithms/kk.py>`_


Coming Soon
------------

-   Implementations

    -   Marple FFT-based
    -   B-splines implementation (Bilato)
    -   Haar multiresolution
    -   Sinc / Whittaker Cardinal
    -   and more!

-   Documentation
-   Jupyter Notebook Examples
