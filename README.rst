Hilbert - Discrete Hilbert Transform Implementations
============================================================

**Hilbert** is a project that will contain numerous implementations of the 
Hilbert transform for discrete data. This will hopefully enable users to 
compare different implementation, such as the newly introduced LeDHT (see 
below).

arXiv manuscript on a learned-matrix approach to the DHT (LeDHT): https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.00666

-   Jupyter notebooks to recreate the main and supplemental text figures
    (and data) are included in the Examples folder

Currently Implemented
----------------------

-   Discrete Fourier Transform-based

    -   Henrici [1]_
    -   Marple (SciPy and MATLAB's *hilbert* implementation) [2]_
    -   Haar wavelet-based (similar to Zhou-Yang [3]_)

-   Learned-matrix approach to the DHT (LeDHT) [4]_
    -   Data and code from the arXiv manuscript is available in the Examples folder as a Jupyter Notebook

Installation
-------------

**NOTE**: The `Examples/` folder (and data) are not included in the pip installation.
You will need to download the file from the `GitHub repo <https://github.com/usnistgov/Hilbert>`_ manually. 

Using pip
~~~~~~~~~

.. code::

    # If this fails, try hilbert_toolkit
    pip install hilbert-toolkit

Using pip (soft install, i.e. can update with git)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code::
    
    # Make new directory for pyMCR and enter it
    # Clone from github
    git clone https://github.com/usnistgov/hilbert .

    pip install -e .

    # To update in the future
    git pull

Usage
------

.. code:: python

    import numpy as np
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    from hilbert_toolkit import hilbert_fft_marple as dht
    from hilbert_toolkit import hilbert_pad_simple

    dht_pad = lambda x: hilbert_pad_simple(x, dht, 1)

    n = np.arange(-500,501)

    sig_analytical = -2 / (n + 1j*50)
    plt.plot(n,sig_analytical.real, label='Real Part')
    plt.plot(n,sig_analytical.imag, label='Imag Part')
    plt.plot(n,dht(sig_analytical.real), label='DHT{Real Part}')
    plt.plot(n,dht_pad(sig_analytical.real), label='DHT-Pad{Real Part}')
    plt.legend()
    plt.xlabel('n')
    plt.ylabel('Amplitude (au)')
    plt.show()
